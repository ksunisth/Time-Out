# Time-Out
An app to remind you to take a break from the screen.

Note: It works on MACOS only, but can be modified for Windows

A notification pops up every 30 minutes to remind you to take an eye break. Another window pops up to ask if you'd like to take your time-out. If you answer Yes, the screen will turn off for 20 seconds. If you answer No, a fun fact message and images will appear after 10 minutes.
